You gotta give yourself more time to do stuff because there will be days where you just do work. If on average you give yourself 2 weeks to do a paper, give yourself 3 weeks and push yourself to work when you have good days. Know that going to be tiring to try to work as soon as your depression temporarily lifts and just take things in small increments. Write a paragraph a day for 3 weeks and or write two paragraphs when you miss a day due to depression and voila! Same results, different pace, depression included and worked around. Practice self care and indulge in the fee things that make you feel okay. stay in your dorm/apartment constantly. Seriously, even if you go to the library for a few hours a day, it helps with isolation. If you like to write, start roleplays with people on geeking or rolemance and reply when you need a break from academic writing. Otherwise indulge in low energy hobbies. And try to eat 2 meals a day even when you feel like it. It makes a difference. Overall, the transition is going to be rough and even more rough for you because of depression so try not to get stuck in a loop of bad habits. Break your routine if not making you feel good and professors are more understanding than not about late assignments and group projects. Be candid with them.

My antipsychotic was risperidone.. which I honestly am still dealing with a side affect of it till this day. I'll be honest, I took those combination of drugs for like 2.5 years, and just stopped. I learned how to deal with the symptoms a lot better than I did from years prior.. looking back.. thst could've gone poorly. I'd recommend being open in discussion with your psychiatrist about the effects these drugs are having on your body and your mood. There are quite a few drug combinations for this type of diagnosis, and it would be wise to work dilligently with your psychiatrist until you find the combination for you. Don't be afraid of them changing your meds. They aren't work anyway, so you may as well be open to working with professionals to find something that works for you and your body. I'd also recommend to try being aware as possible if the symptoms, the triggers for those symptoms, and look to grow from them even while on these medications. Keep a close eye out for unwanted side effects. A lot of the medicines they may try to prescribe would require regular schedules blood work. I'll be honest, I did the irresponsible thing and ended up just not taking them. I got tired of taking medicine at that point; because, I had been taking it all my life. Whether it was for childhood epilepsy, ADHD, depression, and the last diagnosis cyclothymia. Was hospitalized twice before I got the cyclothymia diagnosis, and it was pretty bad at one point, and looking back.. I'm really lucky I didn't mess myself up by just stopping cold turkey.

I read it in a really bad period, and for the first time in a long time I felt really good again for a couple of hours. When those couple of hours came and went and I started to feel crappy again - I read the book again. It's not a big book, took about an hour and a half to read. I carried it everywhere with me for the next few weeks and whenever I could feel myself getting low, I'd read it again when I had the chance. I found over time the low moods became less and less. I also deactivated all my social media accounts while I could get my head around it all. I started buying more books on mindfulness and regularly read them. Besides understanding the present moment, it also helped me figure out my issues. Like, the root cause of my issues. As soon as I started to accept and own my feelings and the reasons I was analysing everything, it lifted a massive weight.

I can understand it down to my core.\",\"I wanted to have a kid for selfish reasons, I wanted a reason to live and I wanted someone who understood me. I feel like no one in this world can understand me and therefore no one is willing to put up with me, if I had a kid I could raise them the way I was raised and they would have the same genetics as I so I feel like they would have a chance of understanding me. Also it's pretty much a guaranteed way of having a companion for 18 years, and if you play your cards right it's someone who will tend to you in your old age and sit with you as you die. All that being said you'll notice I used past tense wanted instead of want and that's because I got hit with several physical illnesses that make it near impossible for me to have a kid (or even take care of a kid) and even if I were miraculously cured tomorrow I wouldn't want to risk passing on these illnesses and causing someone to suffer as much as I have suffered.\",\"I feel that it's hard to exist.

Whether it's a happy evening spent with family or an exciting roadtrip, everything just has something off about it. I also have anxiety, so this may play a role as well, but nearly every situation I can think of is tarnished by this overwhelming feeling of something being wrong. You feel out of place all the time and disconnected, like you're missing out on something everyone else is getting. And for me, I have no idea what is wrong, since it's impossible to pinpoint what isn't there. Thus, since the emotional side of everything is numbed, this feels like a storybook somewhere I'm a useless side character that the hero will never meet or care about. I want to feel happy, I just... don't. This blankness is what's really killing me, because now I can't build relationships or imagine a future. I'm destined to live alone and with no purpose. If you want a better grasp of the perspective, imagine seeing everyone as perfectly fine whereas you, for whatever reason, are the most ugly and screwed-up person imaginable. I know (or think I know) that it's rubbish, but I can't help but believe the voices, you know?\",\"Yeah, I find social media really mentally unhealthy. I already have a bad habit of comparing myself to people, and social media just encourages people to do so.

Adults have the same issues with heartbreak and money trouble as teens, the only difference is they think they're experienced. No one is experienced. Everything that happens to you is the first time that unique situation happened to your unique person. Your reaction is the only thing that changes how these events affect you. I know it's generalizing a bit, but if only good things happen to happy people, it's because those people tend to focus on the good things that happen to them and view the bad things that happen as an obstacle that they need to overcome.

Being terminally ill for the past 7 years (Im 42 now) the physical pain of a slow and horrible illness has led to my depression and desire to die. It is up to my wife though. And for her I live every day in hell. When you have even one person to keep you going, it can be enough. I am a lurker here and I read posts to give me perspective. Rarely can I physically reply. But what my experience being bound to a bed 24/7 has taught me is that once I made my peace with dying, I became indifferent to everything. For myself It's been tough to see people truly depressed to the point of wanting to die. I am very empathetic, but my depression is a symptom so its hard to understand. The one thing I do understand though is that the last thing you want to hear is Don't do it!!! Call this number... or other similar programmed/indoctrinated responses. So just know this... The world and life can be one big shitshow... So it helps to keep toilet paper handy. Let your friend be your toilet paper and be your friends toilet paper. It will be enough.  Lastly... Just remember that no matter how bad life feels (and is...) even I am artificially grateful for the fact that I have a far better life right now (suffering from *pain and bound to a bed), than 99.999999% of all humans to have ever lived. Just try to make it as long as you can. Know how much worse it can be. And let your toilet paper know that you need them to help clean up some shit. Then when you are ready to go.... You will know. But I cant see it happening for you as long as you remain attached to someone that you can call a friend. So give yourself a list of requirements that must be met for you to end it all. *- Pain so severe that causes me to vomit my own feces at times as it sends my body into shock. I wish you the best. I hope you can suffer less in time if possible. You and I are here right now... That makes us stronger than those who gave up yesterday. (And if you do one day come to the realization that you must go, make sure to do it in a way that allows your organs be given to help others. It helps me knowing that maybe I will have something that can give a healthy, long, and amazing life for a person who is still able to live it. ) Just think about making the list... And go tell your friend, right now, that you love him/her... Even if they are not quilted and only 1-ply thickness. You both need that right now... The whole world needs that right now.  Edit: sorry for the novella and my poor humor. Brain isnt what it used to be.\",\"What types of jobs are you applying for? I ask because every single job (since graduating college) I've ever had has been a job where the company required a degree, but the job itself didn't necessary need the skills provided by a degree. They used the degree as a way to weed people out. I have a BA as well, and student debt, but I don't feel like it wasn't worth anything. Even though I took a pay cut with my new job (for better benefits), my income is still more than the average income for a family where I live. I say this because, at this point, you can't change that you got a BA. You just gotta accept it and don't dwell on the I should have dones because if you do, you'll just fuck yourself over and the negativity will eat you alive. Now, you just gotta make a plan - what can you do with your degree? What are some skills you learned from your degree and previous jobs that can transfer over to something else? Is there anything at all you can cut from your budget? Get a roomie? Etc. Plans suck and when you're already depressed, the are the last things you want to be worried about, but it's hard to change things you don't like without one.

All-or-nothing thinking, hopelessness, knee-jerk dismissals; these are all habits that depressed people make in their speech that perpetuate their own misery. It takes conscious effort to recognize our speech patterns as poisonous and slowly change not cares, you the one suffering.

Make friends in your course, it helps to know you're not the only one in struggle town, and if you get stuck you can ask someone. Also think hard about why you're studying what you're studying, be in it for the right reasons. Keep in mind university isn't for everyone, and it isn't the only way to lead a fulfilling life.

The danger of drinking goes like this: Alcohol makes you numb. While also making your focus more on certain things. So, if you are angry and you drink, you might start to feel less angry. This because alcohol is making the problems go away, just becoming less conscious. The common thing that happens is we trick ourselves into thinking alcohol = less The reality is that there is less of anything. There is less pain, but there is less joy, jealousy, curiosity, on the spectrum of sobriety, stone sober is at one side and unconscious is on the other side. In other words, the more you drink, the close you move to passing out...which explains why you feel less the more you drink. This seems like not the worst thing in the word. But the problem lies in revisiting sobriety (which is why I call it an if The feelings return and feel stronger than before. This is often what promotes alcoholism. a perpetual escape from returning return of feeling. This is not to demonize alcohol. Like I said, all about how used. Since, underage, I recommend it.

Obviously a very painful experience. Of course you're not crazy for feeling like that makes you wonder about your value as a person, but to get through this life you'll really want to get to the place where you understand other people's behaviors are a reflection of them and not of you. I'm not trying to suggest some stupid mind-trick here, of course when someone chooses another person over you, you are going to have thoughts of worthlessness and insecurity. But even if someone you are with realizes they'd rather be with someone else, it doesn't require them to cheat on you, they could just be an adult and end a relationship before doing something behind someone's back. Human love is fickle. There's no way to ever say that anyone who decides to spend time with you owes it to you to honor that choice forever, but it certainly doesn't mean they have to cheat and lie. This advice has stuck with me ever since I heard it on a podcast; don't ever expect other human beings to be rational, or to assume they are playing by the same set of rules and understandings as you are. They lived so much of their lives before you were ever it in, you have no idea if this behavior could be a reflection of something somebody else did to them in their past or whatever. You can't blame yourself for other people. Otherwise a total stranger could walk up to you on the street and punch you, and you'll spend the next week wondering what you did wrong instead of identifying that person as a violent crazy person. Regardless, it isn't exactly the most logical part of your mind that is going to feel rotten about this for a while, so no amount of information is going to make it feel better right away.

When I was suicidal the pain I would cause my family was sometimes the only thing that held me back. I tried to think of them as living proof that Depression (personified for metaphor) was wrong about me. It told me nobody cares, nothing matters, if you died nothing would change. I showed it my mother and sister, and told it even if you see no value in me, others do. Basically, in my mind, I used my family as a logical check against the lies. Depression knows it is irrational; like a con man, it relies on persuasion rather than facts.

In conversations with my therapist, we have discussed me having some kind of attachment disorder around this. I am constantly seeking and craving connection with others. I can be at an airport and be thinking about connecting with other people. We traced it to childhood stuff (no surprise there) of abandonment and alienation, unmet emotional needs. Then when and if I do connect, my expectations are pretty high since I am willing to do whatever to reach out to the other person and increase the connection. When that is not reciprocated to the expectations that I have (because they are not trying to fill the massive hole that I am), I feel rejected and then shut down. I internalize this sense as a rejection of me as a person (they don't like me, I'm not worth liking, they got to know and discovered i'm no good). Rinse. Repeat. That's my pattern at least. Knowing the pattern helps, but it doesn't mean I can always identify it and stop it. Thanks for letting me share.\",\"That's a very poetic reminder. I will be scripting it in my journal.

Peterson?\",\"ye i thought so too. except im sitting alone crying and they're out doing normal-people stuff and having fun.\",\"I saw your post several hours ago and I've been thinking all afternoon about what you asked. I'm not sure if I can fully explain the shift I made from being depressed and suicidal to the generally happy person I am now. There was a whole series of decisions and lessons and realizations I've made over a period of several years which probably merits its own post (or series of them). I joined this a short time ago and have been sort of lurking, trying to understand this community and seeing if I have anything to contribute, and your post makes me realize that maybe just telling my story will help others make their own way on their journey. To answer your specific question, the one thing I have come to understand is that there really isn't going to be a time when you are entirely done with it. There will always be a chance, however small, that you can fall back into it. However the longer you go without falling back in, the easier it gets. I tend to think of it in terms of black holes and orbital bodies. I'm going to have to create a post on that. The truths I've found is that recovery and freedom from depression is about breaking habitual negative lines of thought by replacing it with more positive ones. It's about learning how to recognize when you are falling back into the pit of depression, and being able to pull yourself back out. It's about accepting and finding value in yourself, and finding many many reasons to continue to be alive, to contribute and interact with the rest of the world. Coming from the other side, I understand so many things that I used to see as negative really don't have any sort of positive or negative connotation. That was all in my head. Often those negative connotations were put there by others, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes deliberately. I had to learn how to strip those ideas off and choose a new set of ideas to assign. I learned how to identify what kind of ideas were worth keeping and using, and which ones were not and discard them. I know this doesn't really explain much how I see things now, and how I no longer feel depressed all the time, but I promise to share my story in the hopes of helping you understand how I got where I am, and maybe help you make a similar journey.\",\"Sorry I ate them all lol\",\"Tell him to get some professional help, do your best to offer support but regardless of your relationship with them it is not your job to heal them.

It really builds up my stress in school and takes away from the sleep I need to get through the next day.\",\"That's cool. Legos are awesome.\",\"I assure you that you are not as ugly as you think.

Shit, I'd just be happy to be able to sleep at all.\",\"Yeah i feel ya its kinda like a part of a song that i once wrote every single night in my dreams i die waking up dissapointed im still alive\",\"What makes you say these things?\",\"I thought so until I came to realized that your health department is seriously lacking. Getting a pension would be really nice, if you have that in your country, but it's usually quite low. But beside that, the health is too damn hard. Of course you got 70 years old being president or running marathon and all. But I've seen people around me and it's just a blend of being tired, in pain, and or being slow, clumsy, close to handicap doing basic things. It scares me, especially with all the diseases that my relatives have or had, and the fact that I don't take care of my body as well as I could/should... Sorry if this is triggering anything in anyone, or a bit despairing. One upside is that science is doing wonders, so in your life time you could survive more shit, being treated better, and I believe our generation is going to react to the way we take care of the elderly in general.

It was one of the best experiences I had to get better. I help it works out for you. I was facing hell back then. The only thing I didn't like was the therapists and people running the program always reminded us we had mental illness and mentioned mental illness constantly. It was fucked up. Other than that it helped a lot.\",\"None of that fucking works. Anyone who thinks it does doesn't understand depression or what anyone here is going through. The only time it works is if it is a genuine expression of love and care from someone important to you. Not this generic bullshit that you get fed every other day\",\"Oh boy, I was also upset.

Worst case: it's awkward. Best case: you'll get a friend\",\"in a similar situation, honestly. It sucks.\",\"Rather than seeing an entire population, you are seeing a narrowed down group based upon one specific topic. It may seem hat there are a lot of relationship and family conflicts posted about here because those are large factors in depression. There is no one cause to depression.

If you wanna talk here\",\"No. We were born to reproduce, then die.\",\"Talk with your teachers, ask how you can get caught up and back in the swing of things. Most teachers would be happy to have you reach out, plus by being in communication with them, they'll be there to help keep your motivation up. Work out a plan for each class on how to raise grades, maybe see if you can stay before or after school with one of them to have them monitor you while you work. I hate to say this, but school academics come over sports. If time mangement is becoming hard, maybe ask if you can lower yourself from captian position. Freshmen year is easiest for most, so you might want to get help now to save yourself from only deciding to change say in junior year.

How are you feeling ?\",\"Often times people take laughter as a cue that what doing is okay. I do the same thing whenever someone picks on me, even though it hurts inside for all of us. let other opinions influence how you see yourself, as hard as that can be. &lt;3\",\"I'm sorry that haopened. I've never had a breakup because I always get rejected. I've had similar things so I can at least get an idea of how that must feel.

List everything on a paper or make a note in your head what you need to do to make things better. I'm still rebuilding right now. But I don't have this dark ugly building that overshadowed me. Now I can start thinking what the fuck I need to do in order for my new building to be beautiful the way I want it. It'll take time but it's all worth it. Allow yourself to rebuild.\",\"The 211 people online right now care. That's a fact. We're all here for one another.\",\"It's a terrible feeling when you try to hold on to even the most minuscule things that bring you any slight amount of joy, and one by one those things get taken from you. What I try to do is work back on a route to the thing that would lead to getting the one thing that could be right. i.e. something that costs money makes you happy, but you don't make enough money; need a way to make more money; dedicate all free time to applying for better work. Or, feel lonely and haven't got anybody; need to find somebody to stop feeling like that; need to know best places to find somebody; research ways to meet people and put self into that situation. Or feel worthless; being of use to someone or something would make me feel less worthless; dedicate myself to making myself of use to someone who needs somebody; use free time aiding charity or institution where people need you, and you can feel needed. Honestly, I know it's not that easy a fix, and there will be more bumps to overcome. One of my larger problems is isolation and loneliness, and even having looked at places to go, I still haven't found the courage to put myself into a situation to meet people. But generating a simple starting point where you can do something easily achievable, even just through reading online about how to get started, can make you feel proactive and start to get you into a more productive feeling that maybe it won't be like that forever, and that there is a physical, tangible, mortal way to deal with the situation. So, I would recommend pick a small goal that CAN lead to some form of happiness and work towards that, rather than try to envision this great milestone of achieving happiness in one big leap. Helps you take it day by day a little easier, and I hope that would make each new day, if not better, at least consistent for you. Feel better soon, bud.\",\"Yes, I sometimes have that type of pain. Ibuprofen definitely doesn't help. I don't know of anything that does.\",\"this will probably not help you but i had a very long depression i was unable to do the most simple tasks, sleeping in my own trash, i lacked the energy to clean my god damn place how much more useless could i become? Sounds funny but its true, hurting my self, crying to sleep, no friends and honestly looking back i was a complete waste of space better off to have my brains blown the fuck out. But that doesnt mean we dont have the potential to completely change things around. This was me 2 years ago for a solid decade i was barely hanging on and now ive changed everything around and i do not suffer from daily suicidal thoughts, self harm and long depressing episodes.\",\"I watched a short video once (I'm sure can google but I'm on phone and about to get in car) that compared depression to a big black dog. On bad days the dog is giant and weighing you down and on better days the dog is small and at your feet. This helped me accept a lot more about my life and my depression rather than constantly wishing it could just go away. I would get so mad at myself for being angry/sad but now I know it's like owning an animal--you take care of it and it won't bite you, at least not as much anyway. It's part of who you are and that is okay. I do not have severe depression so I am not on meds, so can't speak for those folks who are, but for me exercise and doing things for me (rather than constantly for others or other people's approval) really helped. It's like learning to be selfish in a good way. Eating less carbs and gluten helped too as they tended to make my body more sluggish which did t help when I already felt sad/slow/tired. I eat a lot more protein and fresh veggies now and I think there is a big difference--especially after 6+ months. I still drink alcohol but now a limited variety of stuff that I truly like the flavor of rather than eh it's here so I'll drink it. Also I don't drink when I'm in a bad place or anything traumatic happened that day/week. It's just a recipe for bad. I don't do any other drugs and I'm allergic to smoke so can't speak on that. I also drink 0 caffeine but that's mostly due to stomach issues--not sure if that would help or not. Good luck!\",\"No because I know it's a fact I'm unlikable\",\"If we weren't insignificant in the universe, would it make living more worthwhile?\",\"Do it now I take cold showers, they help\",\"Oh damn, sorry I caught that. Yeah, me too.\",\"One thing at a time, get up, shower. Even if that's all you get done, it's the first step you have to take.\",\"Its a bummer, I know exactly how you're feeling. I usually try not not feel too much of anything. I brush off happiness with the knowledge that whatever good happened is a rarity I shouldn't get used to or acknowledge. Sadness is can always be treated with a few stiff drinks or an exhausting run. That kind of thinking makes me pretty numb but I'm okay with it, until I find a consistent source of happiness.\",\"You are in no way the odd man out. never once spoken to someone who have *something* that they worry about. Whether grades or work or their looks or their friends or personal achievements or their health or even something they said 5 years ago and still feel bad about. Everyone worries about something, and you or I are no exception. Everyone has two sides: the external self which they show to the world, and the internal self which they hide. All you are seeing is what they want you to see: their happiness and confidence and success. What they hide are their fears, their worries, their guilt, and even their unrealistic dreams. It may seem like the outsider looking in, but I promise you that what you are feeling is very ordinary and natural. You are not alone.\",\"There's always someone out there who cares.

I feel exactly the same and I was trying to be positive for ONCE. I literally am having daily breakdowns because of school right now and honestly I won't make it through this year. The thing is, summer can maybe make you think straight and give you energies to start again, I was trying to say that.

Effective, but not easy on the wallet, or your body. If it's working for you then fly at it but something's telling me that it isn't, not entirely anyways. smoke less and drink less.

I don't remember the website off the top of my head but just google it. I hope this helps! Good luck :)\",\"This was two months ago. How are you now?\",\"I was on a very low dose of Celexa, only 10mg, but that was causing enormous weight gain. I'm really short and I was gaining a pound a month. I tapered off quickly, on the expectation that the mental pain of getting fat this quickly was going to counteract any benefit from the drug. I went off and I'm on gabapentin now, and melatonin, and that usually keeps the insomnia at bay. I used to tell myself meds were a weakness, but being on them is far better than getting fired from a job, which was in the cards if I hadn't gone to see a therapist. I know it feels shameful, but really, it's no different than needing glasses, or a coat when it's cold. If your current meds help you, stay on them, and don't feel bad about it.\",\"That depends a lot on your situation. Some people need to find a passion. Some need more social contacts.

I like to start small, take control of whatever I can. Control is empowering. It could be a simple as just playing the shit out of a stupid flash game, or clearing out all the spam in your email, or reorganising your room. Just find something to keep yourself moving. Writing can help too, just lay it all out there. Seeing your words outside your head can help break the downward spiral of thinking. If it's worse now then that means was better, and it will be eventually. Think of someone you can talk to, who knows you well, and just hit them up and say hi. Maybe a text, maybe an email, just remind yourself that you are not alone. It's a shitty battle but stick it out if you can. If you have a therapist try reaching out to one, and if you don't then see if you can get a friend or a parent to help you find one.

Read a book, watch some videos. Eat a snack. Touch yourself and give yourself a massage. lol theres some ideas off the top of my head\",\"The way you're feeling is natural OP. Breathe. Deep breaths. You can do this. Just one step at a time. Let's talk about this.\",\"Glad you didn't. Made you stronger, remember that. You will make it. One day at a time.\",\"Well, get up, have a shower and do something productive with your day. Finish that book you've always wanted to. Watch that movie you've been waiting to see. Make yourself an amazing dinner or better yet, make some cookies for your workmates. Go visit an animal shelter. Get outside for a walk. Everyone has days where they don't want to human. It's up to you though, if you are wanting to try. Xoxo\",\"Being alone is terrible. I'm sorry you're alone. If I hear an implicit request for a suggestion in there, then I suggest doing just about anything different. Anything, really. Break your horrible, lonely routine. The only thing worse than lonely sadness is the certainty that it will not change. What can you do differently tomorrow?\",\"Same. I used to go to a psychiatrist through my university but since I graduated havent been to see one. It's been 7 months and I have an appointment in August with a new dr. but I'll need to do something by Monday because tomorrow is my last dose of bupropion. These last couple of months have been awful. I have no motivation to do anything which is why I'm out of medication. I've procrastinated and it sucks. When I was seeing the dr. I would actually be happy. Like have moments where I just feel at peace and truly happy. I miss the fuck out of those moments. At least before I didn't know what I was missing.\",\"It's afternoon here in the Philippines. I'm at work now. Can't sleep?\",\"What makes you feel bad about yourself? Is there anything you truly hate about you?\",\"You piece of shit how Dare you make such an insensitive comment to someone that is potentially suicidal FUCK YOU!!! Have some empathy you waste of a human being.\",\"True, in a way that can be used as a cop-out. Life / people have continuously treated you worse than shit, and you developed depression because of it ? Must have caught a bug somewhere ! Depression is complex and the causes vary greatly.\",\"Direct anger and expression can certainly have fantastic short-term gains: if you want someone to hurt like you have, you can hit them. If you are hungry, you can kill that guy eating a taco and then eat the taco for yourself. It may be important to consider the long-term effects: how does that anger affect the long-term goals? What are your long-term goals with them?\",\"I experience this all the time. It increases when I'm in an especially bad place, like I am now.  I feel part of a completely different universe to this one. So near yet so far away. It's horrible but there are times it feels peaceful. It doesn't scare me anymore, and I'm not quite sure why. Maybe because I've been experiencing this for years?\",\"Is there anything I can do to help?\",\"Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Honestly? Never better.\",\"About a week ago I was damn near rock bottom and told one of my closer friends that I was seriously considering suicide, and needed a reason to not go through. This is a long ass quote, but it helped me. It's somewhat personal, but I think the message can be applied to anyone &gt;Life is bullshit and it's full of the shittiest people. I suffered from major depression but I also live by a philosophy. Life is so bullshit - but it's those small moments that make it worth it. Those small, sometimes dumb, moments where you just smile thinking about it. Our conversations, graduating school, seeing a new member in your family being born. It's the small things that bind us together and make it worth the suffering &gt;It hurts like fucking hell. But this life was worth having if it mean[s] coming in and making you smile, even once. Making someone's day. Being in someone's life....\",\"Definitely talk to your doctor if the lack of energy and motivation is interfering with your job, relationships, or quality of life. Even if it's not that serious it still might be worth seeing your doctor just to be sure that it's SAD. There are other conditions (hypothyroidism for example) that have symptoms similar to depression.\",\"in there my friend. I'm here for you\",\"This ^, I went from great ones to shitty ones. now i'm stuck with one that barely even tries to engage in conversations and let alone the awkward silence and 2 week waiting periods.\",\"Not getting better for me either :/\",\"No it wouldn't. What happened?\",\"I've definatley been there, but if I've learned anything through my depression, deployments, college and life in general is that it always gets worse before it start s to get better. And I know how cliche that might sound but I can vouch for it. Life isn't going to be easy, whoever says it is, is fucking lying. Life is about perception, mentality over reality. You are strong enough to survive, you can make it, but you have to believe in yourself. Don't let people, or work, or circumstance dictate you. Only let yourself dictate who you are. You can do this\",\"From what read only if an immidiate threat to yourself they will trace your call and call the cops. quote me on that though as not 100% certain.\",\"I'm not afraid to enjoy things - but - I'm afraid to stress myself by having expectations of great times or great results from things I plan. I try not to expect anything at all - because if I'm disappointed it could drop me waaaaaaay down.\",\"I can only be less sad around kids. They have this energy and innocence that take some sadness out of me. I play with them, make them laugh, feed them, wash their hands. But, I am not around kids very often (I don't have children of my own and relative's kids I see them once a year). But yeah I know what makes me feel better for now. Find what makes you fee less sad, don't aim for the extreme fun and happiness all at once, just less sadness is good.\",\"Hey mine is in two days as well! My friend today was telling me to make plans for it and I responded with the most disentrested eh yeah maybe.\",\"Yes. Usually when multiple things line up nicely. Example: Got good sleep, the weather is nice, and some dude on posted a video of his dog running around with a gopro.\",\"Same here man. at the point where all I can say is fuck life\",\"If you feel like you have nothing else and have tried the alternatives such as meds and therapy, what would it hurt to try? What would you be leaving behind? Are there alternatives? Do you have a plan for when you got there? Unfortunately you can't live simply on beautiful views and sunshine but a new start may be nice\",\"Just fucking do it. what could go wrong. Make your life about being grateful for everything and you will not be disappointed. Stay busy. don't let yourself get lost in anything but her. make loving her your first and for most job and you will never be disappointed or sad.\",\"I mean we only really notice the happy, smiling people because they look and sound the loudest. If you looked around campus I'm sure you'd see that most of us are sad, lonely fucks too\",\"No, that is just really bad withdrawal. Don't confuse that for how you were without them.\",\"My word of advice is just, be careful. If you genuinely feel like you can make it work again, then go for it, but if there's that doubt or feeling that you're going to get hurt again, it might be best to step away. Sometimes you can get back with an ex and it all goes well, but when it doesn't they can get in your head lay their eggs and just dominate every moment of thought. Look at your options and determine what the best result will be for yourself\",\"You mean a romantic relationship, right? Yeahh.. a big part of me wants that, too. But I know I'm not ready. Fortunately, you can be loved in close friendships. Also.. kinda friends with benefits things, too. I personally find those a lot less intimidating.\",\"Have you tried exploring out of your circle of people? I've had trouble making friends too but I found that when I put myself out there by taking a part time job or some sorts, I ended up meeting new people who aren't all that bad actually. As to the depression and anxiety, have you seen someone for that?\",\"I don't feel a connection with anyone. After a while I always end up hoping the date will end soon so I can be by myself again cause it doesn't feel right :s\",\"I think it just could be that you're tired from all the pain and suffering you endured throughout the day, and (as you've said) feel that you dont deserve the bed. But trusy me, that bed will be the greatest thing in your life. Whether its to sleep in, or cry on, you will feel bettee\",\"I'm so sorry you feel that way. Would you like to elaborate? I'm here if you need to chat\",\"Sometimes I'll go back and watch some of my favorite scenes from childhood tv shows. Really lifts my mood.\",\"Hm. Try planning a trip to somewhere that you really wanted to go. That could work. If not, then try some form of meditation.\",\"Not really they are trained to spot people who are just trying to get drugs for whatever reason. It's harder than you might imagine. But there are a few who see our point of view, you might get lucky but doubt it.\",\"You could always leave them and find your own indipendence, sorrounding yourself with the people you love which are not part of your family. Idk your situation actually, but I felt the same way too many times, so lonely and neglected by the ones that should care the most. It happens, but this perception is not necessary the truth. Killing yourself won't solve or change anything.\",\"I missed someone who care either. Let go of all of those feelings. Write it down and just throw it away. It really did help me a bit. Get your mind off things with other activities. I know you can get through this if I can!\",\"I'm pretty young so I haven't experienced much death in my family- maybe my advice isn't the best- but go ahead and grieve. Remember them. The next few days will be tearful and difficult. But then you will be able to pick yourself back up again. Recall the happy times and miss them- get it out, so later on when the pain starts to leave you are left only with good memories.\",\"id just be stoked if i could love someone again\",\"The world is a vampire, sent to drain Secret destroyers, hold you up to the flames And what do I get, for my pain? Betrayed desires, and a piece of the game.\",\"if you would like to talk feel free to send me a PM hun\",\"Well I dont know what to say, do you know why you feel that ? Is there any reason ?

I've been in your place, completely cynical and want nothing to do with the way that society feels we should be. The truth is, you can find comfort in being yourself and falling into where you should be.

It is certainly not your fault. It really does, as others have said, seems like you would be better off without him.\",\"What I'm trying to say is that routine is significantly important, and the first thing many clinical psychologists ask is if you have a job (basically makes you set up a routine) And routines make you less likely to develop depression if they are balanced and will make your enjoyment of life increase as well\",\"People who give that advice probably have those things working for them, but they don't realize that none of it helps depression. Being outdoors just makes me feel lonely as hell and without companionship. And if you're depressed, a hobby can't help you out either because if you have no drive to do anything, a hobby cannot satiate what you're truly desiring.

I have adopted a policy of soft truth when talking about depression with loved ones.

So I try to state the facts like a robot and not be super descriptive or let myself get too worked up.

Plus a great cuddle partner when I cry and I have to sleep alone anymore. I also started walking him, like on a leash like a crazy person walking him. I got him because he was trapped inside my moms car and had a lifelong fear of cars. Whenever he hears one he panics and tries to hide and gets himself stuck places. But he also loves to be outside. So I walk the little guy on a leash. And he gets to go outside and I have to exercise.

I have dealt with depression and anxiety for over a decade and I always thought to myself it will get better on its own. But truth be told, it just kept getting worse and worse. I had to reach out for help before it got better. Personally, it took me time to figure out that anxiety and depression a part of me. It is not who I am, it is something that afflicted me.

It's a daily nightmare. I would say that MAYBE, if I gave advice on it, it would be that I used to have a similar thing with shyness, and with that I pushed myself into more and more social situations and now am not so shy. It MAYBE might work the same way with liking/disliking social interaction. But I do that everyday and I still don't like people. I'm more COMFORTABLE around them, but I still don't LIKE them. And it's an entirely different ball park with depression/anxiety than shyness, otherwise if it were so easy to just 'force' yourself to socialize to fix the problem, I'd be doing it myself.

The pain you are feeling is not foolish nor is it you being weak. When we tend to get into relationships we often more time than not replace friendships with our partners. And as time progresses the person is not just simply a partner but a friend whom is apart of the very foundation our life is build upon. I am not sure why you two broke up. And i know it hurts extremely bad, and life has lost much of its meaning. I will it try to come up with some lighthearted crap that tells you everything is going to disappear quickly. This will be tough, this will hurt, and at times it will feel like nothing at all is worth living for. But i must tell you this feeling is temporary..... it will not last forever. How long it will last i cannot say, when it will end i cannot say either. But take it one day at a time. Do things that are only necessary for your existence. And those that are extra if you are not up to it do it. Within the relationship i am sure there were flaws on both parts, beat yourself up about them. When the time is right started to fix those things. And if in months or weeks time you feel like you want to reach out to see if anything can be rekindled do so.

I pray every night that I die. But yet, here I am...\",\"I mostly just try to keep myself busy with the things I enjoy. Digital drawing, writing, browsing, and watching my favorite shows.

If you are sick it's not your fault either. They want to help you because you're their child. It's normal for them to help you and you don't have to pay them back for that. Don't be too hard on you.

From what my therapist says it's not uncommon for the beginning of chronic depression to coincide with the begining of puberty. I think that's when it started for me.\",\"Good for you. I had a pretty minor drinking habit that I caught and acted on relatively quickly, and I still think about drinking more days than not despite it having been a while now. I'm always amazed at how powerful the sensation of craving can be, and can't imagine what people who've drank heavily for years and years must go through in quitting. Not drinking is one the better things I've done in my life, and the benefits seem to compound the longer you go. My brain seems to work considerably more efficiently, and I continue to feel and overwhelming sense of clarity that wasn't present when I drank. This is all despite still dealing with my mental illness bullshit; obviously things aren't great all the time, but they'd be a lot worse if I still drank a lot frequently.\",\"Hey, mind sharing what your situation is so i can maybe help you?\",\"Yes.

I haven't gotten that far yet because mine was so well-written (lol) and I'm not convinced I won't need it again. But that'll be a next step for me too.\",\"I just can't stand the social media shit. I was really messed up as a kid, chemical imbalance at birth, obese until I was 22, put on antipsychotics around 13. Stupidly stopped taking them and I just got more and more detached from reality. Combined with my very mild ASD I never really got to have much interaction with other kids outside of school, never even really had friends I would talk to during the day. I never learned how to be an adult when it comes to relationships (of all kinds). Because society just developed that way, I guess. Everybody is on their damn phones. God forbid you want to ... *gasp* ... walk up and say hi to someone on the street. I went to university last year and it was a bit better, and liberating, but I still had big trouble connecting with anyone. I made one good friend (my roommate) and met a couple people on Tinder, I tried to go to school clubs and be proactive and not feel sorry for myself. But I just can't connect with anyone unless they are literally forced to be in a room with me, apparently. When I go back I will try to smile more. That's what everyone keeps telling me. To answer your question, I don't think I am depressed because of how we live. I'm depressed because of what essentially amounts to bad luck. But it sure as hell makes my life a lot harder. At the same time, we are lucky to live the comfortable lives we do nowadays. If I had been born in another time, who can say if I would even be alive right now?\",\"It's okay to have a shitty day. It's allowed to defeat you occasionally. What happened?\",\"Don't be scared. Reaching out for help is what you have done with this post and it's small steps that count towards the big goal. Use an anonymous forum for a while to talk if that's what you need. When you feel ready to speak to a doctor please do it.\",\"As someone with ADHD too, I have whole days where things feel like they're fine, but attempting to do anything to fix my situation generally drains me and leaves me agitated and snippy. I feel like an inpatient, able to roam the fluorescent halls, but unable to go outside.\",\"I agree with what you're saying. What about suicide do you find difficult? Just getting the nerve to actually do it, worrying about the consequences, etc.?\",\"Im in the same situation. In fact I dread going to sleep and I dread having to wake up.\",\"Actually I get this a lot. Can't bake a fucking cake? Can't use the coffee machine without creating a mess? Can't make a stupid toast AND drop it? I don't know if it's helpful but right after such things happened I imagine how hundreds of other people on earth experience the same situation right now. Helps me sometimes.\",\"For at least the last 4 or 5 years I've also felt like there's not really any point in living, and yet.... I'm still here.

I thought that if I could go through physical pain, then I can go through mental pain. A physical scar is easier to understand that an emotional one. Having to tend to my wounds to stop the bleeding and cover them up distracted me from what I really wanted to tend to and cover up. There was a couple times where I self harmed because my thoughts were too overwhelming while I was trying to fall asleep. Afterwards, I would spend some time in the bathroom alone, taking care of my bleeding and by the time it was all finished, I forgot what I was thinking about. Self harm was an effort to try and beat life at its own game.

Make a list of such jobs that you can opt for as per your top three skill-sets. 3. The next thing is to look for free or paid online resources to learn about that job and start applying. I would suggest starting with some easy job that you can find without any trouble. For instance, you can do data entry in the beginning.

Going to do the groceries. All battles with myself. Emprisonned in my own brain. I understand you. Keep up.\",\"Yeah, it's an odd experience and I often get incredibley cynical and judgemental about people and life.\",\"the typical easy life of a woman in 2018. Made easy by weak men.\",\"I will make it possible\",\"Cutting the topside of my arms hurt and bled but they clotted pretty quickly. Please use a sterile blade if you're going to cut yourself, and don't go any deeper than just the surface skin. Take it from me as someone who has used self-harm, an infection is not the sort of pain that helps with emotional relief! I also recommend other methods, there are plenty out there that can cause some pretty gnarly pain but are far, far safer than cutting. Are there any taps in your house that have overly hot water? Boiling water shouldn't be used as it will scald and is just as prone to infection and other nasties as cutting, so just try clenching a fist under the regular hot water for a few seconds. On the other end of the scale I found the grabing an ice cube and squeezing as tight as I could helped! I thought it would just make my hand feel numb, but it creates a localised, sharp unbearable sensation that works wonders to distract me.\",\"Same here. Depression made me into a miserable bitter piece of shit when I used to be humble and kind to everyone.\",\"Yeah, what alak said, for real. God, I wish I had that addiction. How do you get that addiction?\",\"What's done is done, but you can change what you do next. Have you been to see student support? Sometimes if you're unwell they can help give you some special conditions to make studying and exam conditions a little easier and flexible. you still have to do the work but it can take some pressure off so you don't feel like you have to cheat.\",\"Aren't we all? It's basically all there is to life.\",\"Actually I find myself taking much longer showers when I'm depressed. Sometimes twice in a day. It's the only time I feel relaxed.\",\"Yup, my therapist described this to me as a triangle: Thoughts fuel feelings which fuel our interactions which fuel thoughts. She said that the only way to escape the loop was to break one of the parts. Obviously breaking interactions would just put on a facade, so she suggested breaking either thoughts by changing perception to be more of what she called rational, (through looking at the ups and downs of any situation instead of deciding based just on the downs) or breaking feelings by re-evaluating them using a similar method. &amp;nbsp; I've always unknowingly found myself back in the loop over and over again, but what I would do in your situation would be to look at things objectively, put a self-aware lens over your life, see what you can do to make it better and make choices from there.\",\"People do actually notice the scars, but they dont know how to react. I had a friend who used to cut herself infront of the whole class. I didn't want anything more than just take that razor blade from her and just giver her a hug, but i was too afraid. Funfact: being afraid in this moment started my depression. About a month ago i was in a train and saw someone sitting with scars on their arms and i wanted to go over and talk to them, but i just didn't know what to say so i didn't go over and i didn't talk to them.\",\"Tbh. I find most people are pressured to 'appear' happy. There's this societal idea that people need to find a 'happy life' or that the pursuit of happiness is the most important part of our lives. Which I honestly think is dumb, cause it implies feeling anything else is meaningless. But feeling depressed does not have less meaning than feeling happy. At least that's my thought\",\"Do you want to talk about it?  (I realized that sentence kinda sounds sarcastic wasn't meant to be)\",\"Depends on the medication, but yes.\",\"I felt the same way at 16 23 now and things are alright. I got through college with a decent degree and got an ok job and my own place and a few good friends. You can get more freedom with time. I promise not special, not super smart or anything just always tried to get through this depression bullshit. So please sell yourself short. Medication can also help a lot if chemically unstable.\",\"It's good that you are spending quality time with your grandma. Our grandparents are only with us for so long.\",\"Good, keep it up. I'm glad someone could get help, being around people in similar situations has certainly made me feel at least a little better.\",\"You don't sound evil to me. Why do you have such a negative opinion of yourself?\",\"Ugh, tell me about it. Although i've been eating, just a lot less than normal,i still just want to lay here and just forget about everything, but laying down leaves me alone with my thoughts always thinking about what was. I've been trying to keep active to keep my mind on other things. You should give it a shot. Go out to a restaurant or something, just get out.\",\"right there with you, not sure it's a positive or negative to dream literally every time I fall asleep.....\",\"Go for a walk or run. Get tired so your body feels like shit. Then your mind will focus on that shit feeling instead of making them up. It works for me\",\"Don't tell yourself that's it's going to be a shitty day. Literally force a smile, beat the thoughts in your head into submission. I read once that people who have terrible sleep can lessen the affects of tiredness by telling themselves they had a good sleep, actually vocally saying to yourself I had a great sleep, and it works. It may not completely erase your sleepy eyes, but it's better than being drowsy all day because you keep dwelling on the shit sleep you had the night before. Placebo.\",\"You better with an ax or a sword?\",\"No you are not a loser in any way. Admiring your depression shows how strong you are. This is something that is hard to get rid of. Believe me I know. important is that you give up and keep moving forward a strong and special person. I believe in you. Have hope. *hug*\",\"An old girlfriend and I have some sort of connection. We both have depression and similar backgrounds growing up. We are able to talk to each other, understand each other. Better than our respective spouses can understand our depression. The only problem is that I'm still not completely over her. She still has a soft spot for me too but it isn't the same as what I feel. We broke up 35 years ago. &amp;#x200B;\",\"sadness is not the same as depression. And people trip all the time and others laugh, it's no big deal and no one cares beyond that moment. Next time, either make a comment about your legs not working, or bow to everyone, or something like that, or just get on the bus and keep going with your day. Imagine if you were a waiter and dropped some glasses- would you walk right out of the restaurant because people clapped?\",\"I'm in your prayers bro. Remember your not alone.\",\"I'm not even my fucking number one. I've tried and then depression steps in, raw physical pain.\",\"well it could always be worse lol\",\"I'm obsessed with video games and spend a lot of time reading or watching videos about them. Unfortunately my depression keeps me from actually being able to play anything. It sucks so much because now I have nothing to go to when I'm feeling down.\",\"I don't have anything to ask, I just want to let you know I hope you get better soon.\",\"What's special about you is that nobody is ever like you! Your personality, your being, your laugh, the lil things you do when people aren't around you are special\",\"I'm in my 50's and have been struggling with depression since I was a child. In my experience, the teen years were quite difficult, so I would say yes, that it did get better. Until it got worse again. Then better. Then worse. Then better. Many many wonderful things have happened during the good times. And I've survived 100% of my bad times. What I mostly have learned over these decades of illness, is that things always shift, eventually. I rely on docs, meds, therapy, and my spouse in bad times, and basically just ride it out.\",\"Don't worry, I'm stacking my tear t_t\",\"You're lucky then. I'm just ugly.\",\"I would be keen to know too\",\"These meds can take up to three months or longer to start working. Please give up yet.\",\"My mother is an alcoholic too, I know where coming from. be your friend.\",\"I sometimes wish for the same thing. That some random event would end my life for me. Like a drunk driver or a meteor falling from the sky and hitting me. &amp;#x200B; It could happen. Who knows what the future holds? But, if I have to do it myself, so be it. &amp;#x200B; Good luck with no longer feeling this way.\",\"Yeah I often wonder if I am just negative/ungrateful/lazy/etc or if there really is a legit label for it. Constant battle in my head.\",\"Absolutely. I always dream from the POV of someone else (usually imaginary). Reading novels and trying to forget reality feels better too.\",\"I had some major shit go on 2 years ago, mother with a brain tumor, my aunt was selling the place, needed to move, I couldn't function enough to clear her place out and find a place to live. I ended up packing up what I could fit in my car along with my dog and went camping for 3 months. I needed that.\",\"Why not? Are depressed people not supposed to feel a little hope at times?\",\"that be nice? I am in the same boat...for about the last 8 years it just keeps getting worse. I am sorry you are going through it too...I am not real hopeful about it getting better for me anytime soon, but I really hope it does for you. it strange that we can believe it can for someone else, a complete stranger on the internet, but not for ourselves? If not happiness, I hope you can find at least some peace and comfort in 2019.\",\"Yeah, with you. longing for the next sincere laugh or anything that I find funny anymore or someone who will play that game with me in real life..\",\"No one's brave for killing themselves. It's the *fear* of living that drives them to end their lives. But something inside you wants to live. If that wasn't true, you'd be dead by now. I'm glad you're still here, and I hope one day you can be too :)\",\"This is so fucking relatable... In every aspect of my life. I know my words won't change anything, but there are others who feel the same. I hope you find your way, OP.\",\"Whenever my one friend who I text is taking too long to reply or has more attitude than usual, I assume that she's either busy talking with people she likes more or just gets fed up talking to me. When my neighborhood friends haven't come to hang out for a while, my automatic thoughts are that they're at another friend's house or at a party having the time of their lives while I sit in my house doing nothing. And at family dinners and birthdays where everyone's happy and getting along, I constantly get the most dark and sickening thoughts in my head that I avoid letting out by ignoring everyone around me. Life sucks :(\",\"and when you cannot even trust yourself, that is when you are the lowest..\",\"Hey there you seem to be going through something, care to share?\",\"Have you tried telling them to get help, therapist, medication, or hospital. You could always call the suicide hotline. I called them when my friend was about to kill herself and it was very helpful.\",\"As long as you arent overdosing there is no reason to get rid of them. Keep them for a rainy day, or if things get consistently worse\",\"Is there any chance of reconsideration?\",\"I try too but often erase what I say before posting, as if I know all the answers when I'm here for help too.

This may sound selfish, but it's good for me to know that there's people out there that feels the pain that I feel every single day. Anyway, have a great day, my friends.\",\"I dunno man, I over come either even with a ton of meds. It really depends on the person.\",\"As a kid there was a brief window of time where I wasn't being bullied as much as I used to, and I had a personality. I made up jokes on the spot, would talk to anyone, was interested in loads of things. Then, something happened and I seemed to just switch off again. It might've been all the rumours that I'd be beaten up by gangs of people every single day in the next school, because I didn't act a certain way. It might've been the continued bullying in that school. Soon enough I was a completely hollow shell once again.\",\"Right. Literally wishing to just die in some random accident and it happens to someone who doesn't deserve it. Happy life living people who definitely didn't want to die.\",\"I usually revert to things I loved doing before the depression, like getting on the computer and playing Rollercoaster Tycoon.\",\"Not sure if i want to know , probably take me down to the next level of my depression .\",\"Same boat, man. Seeing happy couples, especially my friends, is like being stabbed in the gut.\",\"i wish i had someone like that. i've never been close friends with a girl before and sometimes i doubt whether i'll ever get one let alone a girlfriend\",\"I spent entire life alone\",\"sorry to hear. :( is this an ongoing thing or does it come in phases? how does being high help?\",\"I know. I don't get it either. If most people were anything like me, human civilization would crumble - would never have started.\",\"Yup. In my experience sertraline was more intense than (es)citalopram the first few days and I started slow at like 12.5mg. It's really the first week - actually about the first 4 days - effect. The thing that requires the black box warning because it's a surprise if no one tells you to expect it (and not everyone gets it so powerfully). If it's too intense talk to your doctor about cutting back and moving up slower (I've settled on 50mg and that was after titrating up). Try splitting it up into at least two doses so it doesn't all hit you at once - sertraline's got a relatively short serum life and I'm preferring a morning and afternoon dose. ... and during this 'jittery' period try to take it at least 4 hours before bed so you'll have a shot at getting some proper sleep. It gets a *lot* more boring (but still potentially helpful) once your body adapts! Right now all sorts of stuff is going on with your serotonin and it's pretty much the 'psychedelic' part. Once your system adjusts the idea is that the drug is holding a 'buffer' of serotonin in the synapses so it's there when you need it for more even moods and less discomfort, but until that settles down it can be pretty trippy and stimulating (especially with sertraline that has a nice extra dopamine stimulatory effect, which is pretty helpful offsetting some of the more annoying SSRI side effects in the longer term). So if you feel like you're going to jump out of your skin now - yeah, that's normal, and it passes in about those 4-7 days (for me, anyway). Also heads-up that.. yeah, with sertraline, those days included a lot of nausea and (ahem) intense GI effects for me too - that passes too.\"], do_sample=True, max_length = 30,min_length=10, temperature=0.9)"

Before I went to hospital because of depression I was crying a lot and almost everyday. After my therapy was over I met my first girlfriend and then, again I cried from time to time in her arms. After she broke up with me two years ago I didn't manage to cry a single time until now. I'm not so sure about it, but I guess it's all about the heart and to heal it from within and not from the surface...\",\"I always see couples and hate them. Not because I am a bad person (or maybe I am), but mostly because of why I don't have anyone. I've come to the conclusion that people are so shit on everything that they shouldn't be allowed to reproduce. Every single one I've met is always doing stuff for himself/herself. EVERYTHING people do is for personal benefit, nowadays. From the way people start approaching others to the way people break up. * Wanna get a girlfriend? BETTER FIND ONE IN TINDER!. Yeah, let's all start liking some stupid slut's photos that will help you get laid and of course it will NEVER inflate her ego to think she Pretty and successful with men, while in fact she is a nobody to everybody. * Wanna take a girl on a date? BETTER USE MY PARENTS' MONEY TO SHOW I'M A MAN!. If the best thing you have to offer to the opposite sex for them to appreciate, is money that aren't even yours (and for them to like you) why the hell are you allowed to have children? We don't any more of you ass***s running around. I understand that what I am saying might seem over-dramatic to some of you(or all of you) but let me tell you some thinks about me: I am 27, I graduated the university after studying there for 8 years because I had to work and serve my conscription to the army, I've lived(and still am) my whole life with my mother because we were too poor to have a separate house, haven't found a job since I graduated because the financial crisis has ravaged my country and I feel like I have little will and reason to live anymore. I wish something happened and people couldn't have sex for over a year. Only then would society come to the place it was supposed to be. Too many sluts and too many rich kids doing shit they want.\",\"The capacity for love can't be built in isolation.\",\"Is there not any thing that makes you feel good? I know that it may not seem like it, but think hard about it. There has to be something in your life, big or small, that makes you feel in a good way. For me I felt like I couldn't have any good emotions. Only bad ones. I sat down one day and really thought about my life. When I'm with my friends I usually can feel good. Most of all my little brothers are what bring me true joy and happiness. I took hold of this and I try to spend time with them the best I can, and sometimes I won't because I'm in a state of self pity, but I'll realize what I'm doing and pull myself out of my bed and spend some time with them. It always helps me. I understand how you feel, but there has to be at least one thing that makes you feel in a non hurtful way. It may not come right away, but I'm sure you'll think of something if you really try hard. Best of luck.\",\"Do you think you care too much?\",\"Something's not right up there. Have you seek treatment?\",\"Just to say I was totally in that place at the start of last week when I went on holiday.

I hope things start to feel a bit better and you get some relaxing in.\",\"I have a fairly normal life but I think about killing myself on a daily basis. Nothing really engages me anymore, and it hasn't for a very long time. Maybe I've just not found something I like. More likey I feel I can't be myself for whatever reason and have to pretend to be something or somebody else to fit in. It's incredibly cliqued I know but that's how I feel. I know that eventually I will kill myself it's really just a matter of when rather then if\",\"Yeah, this feeling is a strong one. Felt it consistently for a lot of my childhood and early adulthood. The truth is that I never dealt with it constructively, or at least in a way that could help me get to the root of that feeling. Part of the reason I think you and I are on this in the first place is because we were never taught how to deal with that feeling constructively. In my case, I used constant denial and self-numbing ... At some point, I just assumed the pit was a part of me I could choose to ignore. You seem to be actively trying to experience it. You are engaging your sadness, which is objectively good for working through depression. It may not be what you might call 'conventional' but everyone does their thing a little differently :) If what you are doing no longer works for you though, it might be best to start looking for other (healthy) ways of working through that discomfort. Personally, when I feel that pit, I know what thoughts tend to follow it. Fortunately, my therapists (and my stay at hospital) helped me come up with ways to attack that pit when it hit me hard. In order to redirect those thoughts that create it, I try to reach out to anyone in my support net. It's hard because I feel like they won't give a shit, but most of the time, they do (but I often choose to ignore that reality). Or I will simply write some positive words here, on this. Reaching out to others here in positive ways is not just for others, but for my own sake as well. As you put so well, giving that pit a 'purpose'. But don't cover that feeling up. Continue to engage with it, as best as you can. It's there for a reason. Hopefully, the more you work with it, the easier it is to process and let go.\",\"Why is that depressing? You should not let the amount of followers determine how you feel, especially not to this extent. It is not a reflection of what you are worth nor how successful your life is. Even if you would get more followers, what would this solve? You would not even know who most of those people are. I also doubt that an illusion like this could provide anyone with actual happiness. And Instagram has a pretty messed up algorithm anyway, I would personally not even bother.\",\"Last year I started dating the love of my life without a single doubt in my mind. My depression resurfaced tho and I started to push her away right into another man's dick. The worst part is that you can't exactly warn them about how you're really feeling and the reason why you're pushing them away because it's hard for them to understand, potentially making everything way more complicated. I don't know enough about you but I know that my heart is fragile so I put up a wall around me to protect it. But sometimes i open up a hole in the wall and it can be pretty darned beautiful.. or disappointing. Luck, maybe?\",\"Maybe you can find a room mate or something ? Idk what type of housing you live in (e.g. apt., house, renting, etc.) but that may help cut monthly expenses in some way too if that's something you're looking for. Maybe get a pet if your housing accommodations allow it. Pets really help with loneliness and depression sometimes. People can even actually get their pets registered as official emotional assistance animals. In some cases, they will be allowed to live in certain housing areas in which pets would otherwise not be allowed. Sometimes it's easy to focus on the negative of living alone. But there are tons of good things about it as well. You just gotta look towards those as well.\",\"I went to the doctor and told her my problems, I got redirected to a therapist and she helped me a lot.\",\"Depends on what you want to do.

I feel like a big part of my depression is loneliness. I can't make friends. I want friends but even when I put myself out there, I can't say anything. It's like my mouth is taped shut. Makes me uncomfortable so I leave. Then I feel lonely, then I try to put myself out there... the whole cycle starts again. I've tried sports clubs, and other extracurriculars. I guess I just wasn't meant to have friends.\",\"It's fucking weird. I often have to bring every ounce of willpower up to bring myself to go to a party with frends, even though I know it will be good. But once I'm there, I'm often the Life of the Party, or so I think. I had people coming up to me, greeting me by my name and telling me how much fun they had last time we had met each other. Which was a year ago. For the first and last time since. I barely remembered their faces and not a single name. So I guess I left an impression. I really like to banter, to do play on words and take words from their mouth and turn them around in a fun way. I joke and tell stories with expressive facial expressions and big gestures. I'm sarcastic, sometimes even cynical. And I joke a lot about myself, mostly in a non-flattering way. I think people like me in general, I seldomly had someone outright refuse to interact with me. But on the other hand, as soon as I come home, I feel a crushing void and I feel alone and that everything is pointless. Those feelings remain in my day-to-day life. And it starts to interfere with my work, for example. I am not one to contain my feelings in an enviroment where I spend most of my days and life in. My boss already told me once, in a pretty long phase of being really depressed, that even my collegues said that something must be seriously wrong and the have no fun working around and with me if I'm in such mood. I can be fun at work, too. I made my co-workers laugh on a lot f different occasions. But that happens in good phases. But there are very bad phases where I, at best, don't say a single word all day unless absolutly necessary and at worst, I am filled with rage the whole day and can't contain it. Last week I was as close to quitting my job as I was never before. Maybe it would be best for all.  Whatever, long story short: I think I can be really funny, too. Despite the fact I feel fucking miserable inside or do not feel anything at all.\",\"Instead of trying to think of something good why not set out to make something good.

Not surprising at all that it has made you feel a lot better at 3 weeks, that's when it usually kicks in for me as well. And yes they are designed to build up in your system over time.

A lot like an addiction you have to fight to get out of it. And it's hard to tell what path is right or wrong. Talking to people does help. But you need to find someone you can talk to. I couldn't talk to my mom for the life of me, my sister would tell my mom or tell me I was wrong, my dad just gave me a look and didn't know what to say besides he cares about me. Once my mom knew the extent of my depression she became better at helping me. She listened and didn't judge. She let me talk and told didn't lecture but reassured my decisions. She went out of her way to make me feel more confident. That's the person you need to find. Also try writing your feeling down whatever you feel on a peace of paper what ever is on your mind. Write it in chicken scratch don't worry about how ty write just write what you feel. Then throw the paper away. That used to help me, not as much as my mom did but I did help.

It would be better if your body was introduced longer to the 15mg (2weeks) then bumped up to 30mg, but I see no complications or issues with being bumped up to 30mg this early in the game. Side effects of Mirtazapine are that it will make you tired, so the motivation and everything may be an issue with your adhd... Again look into vyvance.

People would call you or I selfish, but who are they to assign life or the absence thereof. Many people can't relate to such feelings of loneliness and unworth. But for those who can, being called selfish for suicidal thoughts, makes it all the more confusing of a situation. It also shows you who really cares, cause calling you selfish is just choosing the victim route, for themselves, which is fucked. While some may call it manipulation. Whatever the name, it's hardly sympathetic, and isnt even close to empathetic. Which, empathy, is what this world is lacking.

I need a balance of alone time and time with friends to start feeling like myself again, and if I get that balance wrong I can meltdown. I tend to downplay my problems to the people around me and upplay them to strangers. For example, inflate things for the sake of a conversation with some crisis volunteer or something, just to get some free sympathy and support that I have to feel weird about later because I see that person again. But, if a friend asks me how doing, my first reaction is to reply I have good friends so they call me out on this. I self sabotage by missing appointments or shutting out natural light. If cold, thirsty, hungry or uncomfortable, I ignore it and let myself suffer. I know getting better when I start doing certain things for myself. If I make myself some tea or get more blankets or sit somewhere other than my bed, I tell myself because I care about myself and want to feel better. I have physical pain associated with depression, usually I feel an ache in my arms and legs. When I have the energy I stretch to alleviate it. This also helps me feel better. I have to be conscious of whether I have the energy to do something, because if I force myself I could get overwhelmed and just sink further down. had to learn to say no to people when what they ask of me is more than I can provide without suffering later. But, for the most part, learned my depression will leave when good and ready. been going downhill for two months and had a meltdown a few nights ago so been thinking a lot about what I really need to get through these times. These depressed phases tend to last 4-6 months for me so still got a long way to go. This my first rodeo, though, prepared. learned that there are plenty of little things I can do that feel like self care. Self care is not always an elaborate bath with essential oils and red wine. To me self care is getting up to make a cup of tea, spending a couple minutes stretching, or ordering food when hungry instead of waiting until everything is closed and starving. It have to make you feel better all at once, but all those little things add up, and it means more when you put conscious value on it. will stretch so my body hurt so much, and I do this because I care about feeling I say to myself.

Things they heard from other people and things I think they imagined. About 80% were completely untrue. I was a disappointment and a sinner. I was sad to be away from my boyfriend and glad to be away from him at the same time. He was considerably older than I and of course I had envisioned our life together as different. The second time I ran away I had a better plan partly. I took my clothes and anything else I could throw in my friends car and went to her house where she lived with her grandparents.

I grew up very depressed, my Mother passed away when I was 2 1/2 years old, then my older sister passed away few years later. Every day I was sad. I didn't understand what happened, I didn't understand how something so terrible could happen and life changed drastically and in a flash. No one talked to me about any of it and I was broken.

They always seem overwhelming because I don't know how to handle failure of rejection of really any kind of pain or even mild discomfort. I am a wimp. And yet, they still treated me at the hospital - multiple times. I was never told to suck it up; I was taken seriously and given the help I need. It isn't about the external circumstances, it's about how we react to them. So if you need help, *that's okay*. You aren't any less of a person. You are worth just as much as anyone else.

The biggest struggle with depression is the isolation box it confines us in. It fools us into believing there is no one that will understand. Tells us not to burden others with our problems.

We feel lonely, hate that we feel lonely, feel stupid for looking weak, and decide to keep it hidden. We find worth in our connection to others. Not because they decide if we are worthy or not, but simply because our ability to contribute what is in us is only useful in light of others.

Getting out of the house is recommended even if it's something like going to work. Obviously do whatever you feel is best but I don't think skipping work is going to help you get any better.

Modern psychology/psychiatry is completely incapable of helping those who are in severe pain with lifelong battles with mental illness. It often feels like we are just vehicles of pain who live so that others don't suffer from grief should we commit suicide. As we develop a greater sensitivity to the cost of mental illness, policies and social norms will change: Some countries now allow for euthanasia for those with chronic and unbearable mental illness. But what's strange about all of this is, even though I'm certain I have the right to kill myself because I'm miserable everyday, I am pulling for you to live, even though you're a stranger on the internet.

Or also the pressure of feeling others' expectations of you on your shoulders. I still haven't worked things out that I'm able to effectively handle failure myself, but mainly people can feel better when they fail, because they recognise it as a learning experience, or it is an inevitable part of the process. Now this may sound obvious, but when in the moment, it is very easy to forget this and lose sight of progress after the failure. Failure can appear in many forms. My expectation of a 'good outcome', instead was a horrible mistake... Or was it? I'm sorry to hear you feeling even worse after your suicide attempt.

I've dealt with suicidal ideation for 2 decades, you never really get rid of those thoughts. We are essentially biological computers subject to our programming. We can't delete the program we've learned of suicidal ideation, but we can learn how to combat it, but it is a battle we must be ready to confront everyday. You are blind to your weaknesses but you are equally blind to your strengths. You aren't alone. Don't take your life. You aren't an isolated dust mote among 7 billion other dust notes.

It would be better if your body was introduced longer to the 15mg (2weeks) then bumped up to 30mg, but I see no complications or issues with being bumped up to 30mg this early in the game. Side effects of Mirtazapine are that it will make you tired, so the motivation and everything may be an issue with your adhd... Again look into vyvance. You may gain some weight also, that is a common side effect. Also some anxiety could occur, but that is rare. important to read up on your meds when you receive new ones.

People would call you or I selfish, but who are they to assign life or the absence thereof. Many people can't relate to such feelings of loneliness and unworth. But for those who can, being called selfish for suicidal thoughts, makes it all the more confusing of a situation. It also shows you who really cares, cause calling you selfish is just choosing the victim route, for themselves, which is fucked. While some may call it manipulation. Whatever the name, it's hardly sympathetic, and isnt even close to empathetic. Which, empathy, is what this world is lacking. A partnership society would support each other regardless of their stance or tradition. But, we live in a male dominated, monotheistic world. People suck. The only thing we can do is help them.

I need a balance of alone time and time with friends to start feeling like myself again, and if I get that balance wrong I can meltdown.

For example, inflate things for the sake of a conversation with some crisis volunteer or something, just to get some free sympathy and support that I have to feel weird about later because I see that person again. But, if a friend asks me how doing, my first reaction is to reply I have good friends so they call me out on this. I self sabotage by missing appointments or shutting out natural light. If cold, thirsty, hungry or uncomfortable, I ignore it and let myself suffer. I know getting better when I start doing certain things for myself. If I make myself some tea or get more blankets or sit somewhere other than my bed, I tell myself because I care about myself and want to feel better. I have physical pain associated with depression, usually I feel an ache in my arms and legs. When I have the energy I stretch to alleviate it. This also helps me feel better. I have to be conscious of whether I have the energy to do something, because if I force myself I could get overwhelmed and just sink further down. had to learn to say no to people when what they ask of me is more than I can provide without suffering later.

This my first rodeo, though, prepared. learned that there are plenty of little things I can do that feel like self care. Self care is not always an elaborate bath with essential oils and red wine. To me self care is getting up to make a cup of tea, spending a couple minutes stretching, or ordering food when hungry instead of waiting until everything is closed and starving. It have to make you feel better all at once, but all those little things add up, and it means more when you put conscious value on it. will stretch so my body hurt so much, and I do this because I care about feeling I say to myself.

Things they heard from other people and things I think they imagined. About 80% were completely untrue. I was a disappointment and a sinner. I was sad to be away from my boyfriend and glad to be away from him at the same time. He was considerably older than I and of course I had envisioned our life together as different. The second time I ran away I had a better plan partly. I took my clothes and anything else I could throw in my friends car and went to her house where she lived with her grandparents. The next morning I woke up to my Step Mom standing at my feet telling me to get up and come with her and Dad. I grew up very depressed, my Mother passed away when I was 2 1/2 years old, then my older sister passed away few years later. Every day I was sad. I didn't understand what happened, I didn't understand how something so terrible could happen and life changed drastically and in a flash. No one talked to me about any of it and I was broken.

Getting out of the house is recommended even if it's something like going to work. Obviously do whatever you feel is best but I don't think skipping work is going to help you get any better. For example I could barely get out of bed this morning to go to work but even though I'm here hating it I would alternatively be at home sleeping until 2pm then lay in bed on my phone all day.\",\"What's up buddy ? Want to talk ?\",\"Thought id check out the depression sub, well i have to go now\",\"It is unfair. Modern psychology/psychiatry is completely incapable of helping those who are in severe pain with lifelong battles with mental illness. It often feels like we are just vehicles of pain who live so that others don't suffer from grief should we commit suicide. As we develop a greater sensitivity to the cost of mental illness, policies and social norms will change: Some countries now allow for euthanasia for those with chronic and unbearable mental illness. But what's strange about all of this is, even though I'm certain I have the right to kill myself because I'm miserable everyday, I am pulling for you to live, even though you're a stranger on the internet. I have hope for you and I don't even know you. I want you to wait it out, to battle it out, not because you owe me or anyone else, but because I think there might be something better for you in a day or a week or a decade from now. What have you tried so far to get some relief? Has anything worked? What can you do that brings you moments of enjoyment?\",\"This is the sentence I fear the most. It's why I've never reached out to anyone.\",\"We often ask that question out of habit and rarely out of genuine interest in the answer. It feels unnatural to say anything other than good or fine and we don't expect a different answer than that from anyone else. It's weird that we even ask when you think about it...\",\"pugs are weird but pretty okay\",\"If a puppy isnt a positive thought I do not wish to live in your world.\",\"Yea I need to remember how to do this but I agree\",\"I tried various strengths of Zoloft. It did help a little, but only with certain symptoms for me. I'm also still in the process of getting a correct/official diagnosis though.\",\"I get this. Having no friends is a weird void. mostly lack of distractions I suppose. And filling that void is really hard. Doesnt help feeling existentially lost.\",\"As someone said here previously, depression doesn't care who you are, where you are from, what you have or don't have. Even if you don't have serious problems, depression makes you feel like you're carrying all the problems of the world. It's true btw, there are people who are disabled, blind, deaf and still be happy, I don't have any of these problems, yet feel shit most of the time, and that makes me feel *guilty*..\",\"Sorry this is over a month old but I do hope you are feeling better. The thing about bottom is, there is only one other place to go. Talking things out with someone often puts things into perspective but even the act of just getting things off your chest usually helps. Let me know if you want to chat, I will listen.\",\"Just let it out then, that's what this is place is for. Hugs, hope things become better for you soon! :)\",\"Once you are at the bottom you can only go up. Hope things get better for you :)\",\"What is going on? How long have you been thinking about this? Maybe we should talk about it first and think through some stuff...\",\"I wish I could f*** it instead of the other way around for\",\"I find that how you view failure is tied to your expectations quite heavily. Or also the pressure of feeling others' expectations of you on your shoulders. I still haven't worked things out that I'm able to effectively handle failure myself, but mainly people can feel better when they fail, because they recognise it as a learning experience, or it is an inevitable part of the process. Now this may sound obvious, but when in the moment, it is very easy to forget this and lose sight of progress after the failure. Failure can appear in many forms. My expectation of a 'good outcome', instead was a horrible mistake... Or was it? I'm sorry to hear you feeling even worse after your suicide attempt. Just know that I believe you are alive, and fighting, and you will come out of this stronger.\",\"Sorry man, PC masterrace here. Hope you'll spruce up your friend list nicely.\",\"Why? Thats evil and selfish.\",\"I'm jealous of you artists.. I play guitar and I've gotten to the point where I can usually play how I feel but it makes me feel worse normally...the same sad chords and melodies. Do you have any art you'd like to share? I'd love to see some\",\"You never get over depression it is a daily struggle, but it brings to mind a Bojack Horseman quote: it get a easier but you have to do it everyday. That's the hard part. I've dealt with suicidal ideation for 2 decades, you never really get rid of those thoughts. We are essentially biological computers subject to our programming. We can't delete the program we've learned of suicidal ideation, but we can learn how to combat it, but it is a battle we must be ready to confront everyday. You are blind to your weaknesses but you are equally blind to your strengths. You aren't alone. Don't take your life. You aren't an isolated dust mote among 7 billion other dust notes. You are a node in a network, and the things you do and you don't do are far more important than you think. I wish you the best, and hope you see the power you truly have.\",\"I do. *Kind of.* Let's not mix clynical depression and negative emotions together, they are totally different things. I realize that I'm stuck with the first type. I'm seeing the therapist, taking the medication and blah-blah-blah. Moreover, I can't say that I'm often in the teary mood. It usually feels like I'm tired of e v e r y t h i n g. However, sometimes it's bigger than me. Sometimes I want, no, there's a **NEED** for me to feel miserable. I want people to turn back on me, so I could only feel worse. That's why sometimes I fake the feelings and try to provoke others. I'm lost, *ha haha ha*\",\"in what way do people bother you. Like they personally go out of their way or you mean like everyone including random people annoy you?\",\"You say you'll never be able to move out . . . sure you will! would you be moving to a new city or some where farther away? obviously, to move out, you will need a good paying job and money for an apt (by your self or with roommates.) tell your family that you are moving out on X date, if you are over 18, they can't really do anything about it. tell the police that you are moving away and your family is triggering your depression. they might try to file a missing person report if they notice that you go missing out of no where. suicide, I don't think, is ever the answer.\",\"I'm glad it worked for you. I've been going for a few weeks and so far it hasnt helped, so good that it helps some people\",\"Why can't you ask your parents for help?\",\"Don't worry friend, rant all you want if it helps. I'm here for you.\",\"Like when are waiting in line and waiting, waiting.....when is my turn.\",\"Yess I feel you, and I guess being depressed is bad for you as well so you're just trading one bad thing for another, except this one makes you happy. So yeah basically why I do it\",\"This is so true but sometimes when in the funk of depression, it just feels like those beautiful things/moments in life are so far fetched. Feels like the pain go away\",\"It's true we live in a society where crying in public or hugging strangers are frowned upon. We've gone very far into the illusions of separation and it's going to take some time to break through these, but it's going to happen I have no doubt anymore! I'm sending you love and hugs through the wire even if it's only designed for 0 and 1, feel it!\",\"I don't hate you.  Wait. Are you responsible for the stairs that just aren't quite right? That's on my list of things that I hate.\",\"I have a Computer Science degree and can't find work x.x. Tbh, you can go back and get a new degree it's not to late :). What would you like to do?\",\"I joined here about 5 days ago, because I feel so close to the people here. like my family in a way. I know that sounds weird, but my point. I have depression, and feel alone as well. I feel like what I say matter, and no one listens to me. I do my best in something, and all I get in return is absolute shit! It pisses me off. I feel different as well, like not in the same league as everyone else. a quiet person, and am pretty shy around girls because not sure what they think of me. I think what you need is some independence :) It will make you happy, because that way not around people. I know it seems ironic because then be even more alone, but just pay attention to anyone. Be your own boss, and think of everyone else as just empty space. Think as is it matter what they say. Be a shield. let anyone get in your way. here on Earth, be here for a reason. The reason you feel lonely is because of people. Think about it.\",\"Feeling like you're a failure because you're depressed and you push people away -&gt; being depressed and pushing people away -&gt; repeat\"], do_sample=True, max_length = 30,min_length=10, temperature=0.9)"
